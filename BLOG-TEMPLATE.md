## Tips for Good Blog Posts

1. **Hook readers early:** First paragraph should grab attention
2. **Use headers:** Break content into scannable sections
3. **Code examples:** Show, don't just tell
4. **Be concise:** Respect reader's time
5. **Add context:** Explain why, not just how
6. **Link resources:** Help readers learn more
7. **Proofread:** Check for typos and clarity
8. **Test code:** Ensure code examples actually work

## Post Ideas

- Tutorial: How to do X in Python/MATLAB/etc.
- Project walkthrough: Deep dive into a project you built
- Paper summary: Explain a research paper in simple terms
- Tool review: Pros/cons of a framework or library
- Career reflection: Lessons from an internship or role
- Problem-solving: How you debugged a tricky issue
- Best practices: Tips for better ML workflows
- Comparison: X vs Y - which to use when?

When I started working with surface EMG signals two years ago, I made every mistake in the book. Here are five tips that would have saved me months of frustration.

## 1. Always Visualize Your Raw Data First

Before applying any filters, plot your raw signal. You'd be surprised how many issues you can spot just by looking:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(emg_raw)
plt.title('Raw EMG Signal')
plt.show()
```

Look for:
- Saturation (flat tops/bottoms)
- DC offset (signal not centered at zero)
- Power line interference (50/60 Hz hum)

## 2. Don't Over-Filter

Aggressive filtering removes noise but also destroys signal. Start with gentle filters:

```python
from scipy import signal

# Conservative bandpass filter
b, a = signal.butter(4, [20, 450], btype='band', fs=1000)
filtered = signal.filtfilt(b, a, emg_raw)
```

**Pro tip:** Always use `filtfilt()` instead of `filter()` for zero phase distortion.

## 3. Normalize Within Subjects, Not Across

EMG amplitudes vary wildly between people due to electrode placement, skin properties, etc. Always normalize:

```python
# Within each subject
emg_normalized = (emg - emg.min()) / (emg.max() - emg.min())
```

Never compare raw amplitudes across subjects!

## 4. Extract Features in Sliding Windows

Don't compute features over the entire signal. Use overlapping windows:

```python
window_size = 200  # samples
stride = 50  # overlap

for i in range(0, len(emg) - window_size, stride):
    window = emg[i:i+window_size]
    rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(window**2))
    # Process RMS...
```

## 5. Validate on Real Data, Not Synthetic

Synthetic EMG looks nothing like real signals. Always test on actual recordings before deploying.

## Conclusion

These five tips would have saved me months of debugging. Remember: EMG processing is more art than science - there's no one-size-fits-all solution.
